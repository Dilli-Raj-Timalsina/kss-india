ðŸš€ Complete Guide to CSS Units with Tailwind Examples

CSS has multiple units to define size, spacing, and dimensions. Some are absolute (px, cm, mm), while others are relative (em, rem, %, vh, vw, fr).

ðŸ“Œ 1. Absolute Units (Fixed, Don't Change with Screen Size)

These units are static and do not scale based on screen size or parent elements.

| Unit | Meaning         | Example                  |
|------|-----------------|--------------------------|
| px   | Pixels (fixed size) | w-100px (100 pixels wide) |
| cm   | Centimeters     | w-[2cm] (2 cm width)     |
| mm   | Millimeters     | w-[20mm] (20 mm width)   |
| in   | Inches (1in = 96px) | w-[1in] (1 inch width) |
| pt   | Points (1pt = 1.33px) | w-[12pt] (12pt width) |
| pc   | Picas (1pc = 12pt) | w-[3pc] (3 picas width) |

âœ… Use Case: px is the most commonly used absolute unit.

ðŸ“Œ 2. Relative Units (Scalable, Depend on Parent or Viewport)

These units change dynamically based on their context.

| Unit | Meaning                             | Example                          |
|------|-------------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| %    | Relative to the parent element      | w-[50%] (50% of the parent width)|
| em   | Relative to the parent font-size    | text-[2em] (2x the parent font-size) |
| rem  | Relative to the root (html) font-size | text-[1.5rem] (1.5x the root font-size) |
| vh   | % of the viewport height            | h-[50vh] (50% of viewport height)|
| vw   | % of the viewport width             | w-[80vw] (80% of viewport width) |
| vmin | % of the smaller viewport dimension | w-[50vmin] (50% of the smaller side) |
| vmax | % of the larger viewport dimension  | w-[50vmax] (50% of the larger side) |

âœ… Use Case:

- rem is best for scalable text.
- vh/vw is best for full-page layouts.
- % is great for fluid layouts.





ðŸ“Œ Q1: Do screens with different resolutions (e.g., 1080Ã—720 vs. 2220Ã—3340) have the same viewport height and width?

ðŸ”¹ Answer: No, But It Depends on Pixel Density (DPR)

Screen resolution (e.g., 1080Ã—720 or 2220Ã—3340) is the total number of pixels.

Viewport size (vw, vh) is different from resolution because:

- Devices have different pixel densities (DPR - Device Pixel Ratio).
- A higher resolution screen doesnâ€™t necessarily have a larger viewport in CSS pixels.
- Many high-resolution devices use scaling (e.g., a 2220Ã—3340 screen might behave like a 1080Ã—1920 screen in CSS pixels).

âœ… Example Results:

- A 1080Ã—720 display might return window.innerWidth = 1080 and window.innerHeight = 720.
- A 2220Ã—3340 display might return window.innerWidth = 1440 and window.innerHeight = 2560 if scaled at DPR = 2.5.

ðŸ“Œ Q2: How Does vh and vw Work on Different Screens?

ðŸ”¹ Answer: It Adjusts Dynamically Based on Viewport

- 1vh = 1% of the viewport height.
- 1vw = 1% of the viewport width.

ðŸ“Œ Example:

- If a mobile viewport is 375px wide:
  - 50vw will be 375px * 0.5 = 187.5px.
- If the same page opens on a larger screen (1440px wide), 50vw becomes 720px.
